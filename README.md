# Tip Calculator App

Submitted by **Lily Deng**

**Time spent: 7 hours**

A handy Android application that takes users' inputs for the amount on their check and the number of people splitting the check. The system then calculates how much the tip and total would be for each person, providing calculations for 15%, 20%, and 25% tips. The results will be rounded to the nearest integer to avoid any minor rounding conflicts.

## How to Use
1. Enter a decimal amount (non-negative)
2. Enter the number of people that are splitting the bill
3. Click the "Compute tip" button to calculate all the possible tip and total values, rounded to the nearest integer
4. If there is an issue with the input (i.e. inputting an empty value), a Toast message will appear and you may input a different value instead.
